## Single Inheritance Example
- Parent and Child classes with method overriding.

## Multiple Inheritance Example
- Combining behaviors from multiple classes.

## Using `super()`
- Demonstrating `super()` for calling parent class methods and constructors.

## Method Resolution Order (MRO)
- Explanation of the order in which methods are called in multiple inheritance.

## Employee Template Example
- Example of Employee, Manager, Developer, and TeamLead with inheritance.

## HyperionDev Bootcamp Notes
Inheritance allows for code reuse and logical hierarchy.
- Multiple Inheritance can be powerful but should be used carefully to avoid complexity.
- super() is essential for initializing parent class attributes and methods.
- MRO ensures a consistent method resolution order in complex inheritance hierarchies.
